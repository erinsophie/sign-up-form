Sign-up Form

This project is the first from The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript course.

Given the important role that forms play in almost every website, the goal of this project was to create a sign-up form in order to practice how to style forms and ensure they're set up correctly. This project is created with a mobile-first approach. It combines HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Challenges/Learning Points:

- I opted for Javascript when it came to a lot of the validation for a few reasons. I preferred the fact that you can create custom rules and display more specific error messages when using Javascript. I also wanted to provide real-time validation to users as they type in their password 
- To get the form to behave the way I wanted to required the use of different input and blur events in order to display the right messages at the right time
- It was tricky to get the inputs to show a validation message only when the user clicks away (when the field is not empty) but then change to aggressive validation (updating in real time) when the user is typing
- This was also my first time trying to create a mobile layout created with a mobile-first approach
- I'm glad I got to practice working with such elements and encountering these situations!
